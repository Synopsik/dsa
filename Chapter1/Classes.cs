     * C# is an object-oriented language that supports declaring classes with various members like,
     * constructors, finalizers, constants, fields, properties, indexers, events, methods, operators, and delegates
     *
     * Classes in C# also support inheritance and implementing interfaces
     * static, abstract, sealed, and virtual members are also available
     * access modifiers include public, protected, internal, private, and file
     *
     * Accessors: get to return the property value
     *            set to assign a new value for the property
     *            init to set a value during object construction and prevent modifications
     *
     * By combining accessor we can create permissions categories:
     *           Read-only with the get accessor and without the set accessor
     *           Write-only with the set accessor and without the get accessor
     *           Read-write with both get and set accessors
