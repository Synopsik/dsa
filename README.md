# C# Data Structures and Algorithms

This is a journal of progress through the book listed below. I'll be trying to document and improve how I learn 
to program through the various chapters. If you have any suggestions or tips on how I can improve some aspect of my code 
please feel free to raise an issue so that I can learn something new.
